## Benefits of This Structure

1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Each directory has a specific purpose, making it easier to locate and understand code.
2. **Scalability**: New features can be added following the same organizational patterns.
3. **Maintainability**: Related code is grouped together, making it easier to maintain and refactor.
4. **Testability**: Clear interfaces defined by protocols make unit testing easier.
5. **Collaboration**: Team members can work on different layers without conflicts.

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Protocol-First Development**: Always define protocols for new components before implementation.
2. **Dependency Injection**: Use the DependencyContainer for managing service dependencies.
3. **Layered Architecture**: Follow the defined layers and avoid direct dependencies between unrelated layers.
4. **Consistent Naming**: Follow Swift naming conventions and name files according to their purpose.
